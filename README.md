Node Red Speech to Text and Back to Speech Flow:

You will need to add a few special node types to your pallette in order for this flow to work:

- node-red-contrib-play-audio
- node-red-contrib-browser-utils

Those will allow you to accept audio from the microphone and play through your computer speakers

The guide for this lab will be added as soon as I finish it
